# Introduction

Great! It's always exciting to start learning something new. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three core technologies that make up the World Wide Web, so you're in for a treat.

## What is HTML

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, and it's used to structure the content of a web page. It's what gives a page its basic structure and meaning, and it's the foundation that CSS and JavaScript build on.

## What is CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and it's used to style the appearance of a web page. With CSS, you can control things like the layout, colors, and fonts of a page, and you can apply styles consistently across multiple pages on a site.

#What is JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language that's used to add interactivity to web pages. With JavaScript, you can create things like drop-down menus, form validation, and even simple games.
