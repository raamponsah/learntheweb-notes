On day 2 we look at introduction to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), you will learn about the basics of CSS and how it is used to style and layout web pages.

CSS is a stylesheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. It allows developers to control the layout and appearance of a web page by separating the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS).

### Here are some key concepts to understand on day 2 of your CSS journey:

#### What is CSS?

CSS is a stylesheet language used to style and layout web pages. It is used in conjunction with HTML to create a cohesive and visually appealing web page.

#### How CSS works?
 
CSS works by applying styles to HTML elements on a web page. These styles can be defined in a separate CSS file or inline within the HTML document. When a web browser loads a web page, it reads the HTML and CSS to determine how to display the content on the page.

#### CSS selectors

 CSS selectors are used to specify which HTML elements you want to apply styles to. You can use element selectors (such as p, h1, div), class selectors (such as .classname), or ID selectors (such as #idname) to target specific elements on the page.

#### CSS properties

 CSS properties define the specific styles that you want to apply to an HTML element. Some examples of CSS properties include font-size, color, and background-color.

By the end of day 2, you should have a basic understanding of what CSS is and how it is used to style and layout web pages. You should also have a foundational understanding of CSS selectors and properties.
