HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a standard markup language for creating web pages. It gives web pages structure and meaning by defining the content of the page and how it should be displayed.

HTML is made up of a series of elements, which are represented by tags. These tags tell the web browser how to interpret and display the content of the page.

Here's a more detailed example of an HTML page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  <main>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Jane and I'm a web developer. I love building websites and making them look good with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
    <p>I'm currently working on a project to create a website for a local business. It's been a lot of fun and I'm learning a lot.</p>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <p>Copyright 2021 Jane's Web Development</p>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>

In this example, the <html>, <head>, <body>, <header>, <main>, and <footer> tags are used to structure the content of the page into logical sections. The <title> tag is used to define the title of the page that appears in the browser's tab, and the <h1>, <h2>, and <p> tags are used to define headings and paragraphs. The <nav> and <ul> tags are used to create a navigation menu, and the <a> (anchor) tag is used to create a link.

I hope that helps to give you a more detailed understanding of HTML and how it's used to structure the content of a web page. 

Do you have any specific questions about it?
