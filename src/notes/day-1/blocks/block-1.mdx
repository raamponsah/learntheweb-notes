- Introduction to HTML
- **What is HTML?** -
  
  HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It gives web pages structure and meaning by defining the content of the page and how it should be displayed.
  HTML is made up of a series of elements, which are represented by tags. These tags tell the web browser how to interpret and display the content of the page.

- **What is a web browser?**
  
  A web browser is a software application that allows users to access, retrieve, and view websites and web pages. When a user enters a web address into a browser, the browser sends a request to a web server to retrieve the web page. The web server then sends the web page back to the browser, which displays the page for the user to see.
  
  Some examples of popular web browsers include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari.

- **What is a web server?**
  
    A web server is a computer that stores websites and serves them to web clients (i.e., web browsers) upon request. When a user enters a web address into their web browser, the browser sends a request to the web server to retrieve the web page. The web server then responds by sending the HTML code for the web page back to the browser, which then renders the page for the user to view.

    Web servers typically use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to communicate with web clients. They can also use other protocols such as HTTPS (a secure version of HTTP) and FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

There are many different types of web servers available, including Apache, Nginx, Microsoft IIS, and others.
- **Setting up a development environment**

To set up a development environment for HTML, you will need the following:

  1. A text editor: This is a program that allows you to write and edit code. There are many text editors available, such as Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code.

  2. A web browser: You will need a web browser to test your HTML code. Some popular options include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari.

  3. A local server: A local server is a server that is running on your own computer. You can use a local server to test your HTML code without having to upload it to a live web server. There are several options for setting up a local server, including using a program like MAMP (for Mac) or WAMP (for Windows), or using a built-in feature like the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code.

  4. To set up your development environment, first install a text editor and a web browser on your computer. Then, follow the instructions for setting up a local server on your operating system. Once your local server is set up, you can create an HTML file in your text editor, save it, and open it in your web browser to see the result.
  
- **Installing a text editor**
- To install a text editor, follow these steps:

    1. Choose a text editor that you would like to use. Some popular options include Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code.

    2. Go to the website for the text editor you have chosen and download the installation file.

    3. Run the installation file and follow the prompts to install the text editor on your computer.

    4. Once the installation is complete, you should be able to launch the text editor from your Start menu (on Windows) or Applications folder (on Mac).

    5. If you are prompted to choose your preferred settings when launching the text editor for the first time, make your selections and click "Save" or "OK".

    6. You should now be able to use the text editor to create and edit HTML files.
  
- **Setting up a local server**
1. To set up a local server on your computer, you can use a program like MAMP (for Mac) or WAMP (for Windows). Here are the general steps for setting up a local server using MAMP:

2. Download MAMP from the MAMP website (https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/).

3. Run the MAMP installation file and follow the prompts to install the program.

4. Once the installation is complete, launch MAMP from your Start menu (on Windows) or Applications folder (on Mac).

5. In the MAMP window, click the "Start Servers" button to start the Apache and MySQL servers.

6. To test your local server, click the "Open WebStart page" button. This will open a new web browser window with the MAMP start page, which will show the status of your servers and provide links to tools like phpMyAdmin.

7. To set up a local server using WAMP, the process is similar. Download WAMP from the WAMP website (http://www.wampserver.com/en/) and follow the prompts to install the program. Then, launch WAMP and click the "Start All Services" button to start the Apache and MySQL servers. You can then test your local server by clicking the "Localhost" button in the WAMP menu.

8. Another option for setting up a local server is to use the "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code. To use this option, first install Visual Studio Code and then install the "Live Server" extension from the Extensions Marketplace (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer). Once the extension is installed, you can launch a local server by right-clicking on an HTML file in the Visual Studio Code editor and selecting "Open with Live Server".
