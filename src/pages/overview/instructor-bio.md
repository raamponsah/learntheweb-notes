### Raphael Amponsah
My name is Raphael Amponsah, I am a lecturer at the Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration (GIMPA). I teach Computing Fundamentals, E-Business, Business Intelligence and Management Information Systems.
In my 8 years experience of teaching information technology-related courses, I have observed one key thing.

> Understanding leads to mastery.

This seems missing in our learning today. I have observed the thirst for understanding leading to practice. This is my approach to teaching. I teach that you can understand and work on your own, read docs on your own and not be afraid to practice or take up tasks.

With my 8year experience in coding and teaching, I share with you tips, tricks and depth of understanding of technologies.

My focus with my workshops is to build a sound community of enthusiastic people who are interested in building or developing innovative apps to serve any need they may dream of.

Currently, I am a PhD candidate at the University of Ghana, where I am pursuing Operations Management Information Systems
