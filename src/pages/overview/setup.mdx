# Some General Cleaning
Ahoy! You've made the right decision to up-skill! Learning web development is fun and hard. You'll have to joggle on so many things.
But let me warning you! It is addictive. I am almost obsessed it with. (don't tell anyone). So put on your gears and lets get cracking
on the journey to the land of magic! Happy Coding!

### Technical Setup

This workshop requires minimally a working laptop that has connection to the internet. 
We'll however download text editor and other packages as the need be.

### Mental Setup

The workshop prides on "The Three Es": Excite! Encourage! Empower!. This is the whole basis of this workshop.
That at the end you'll be excited about coding, encourage others and yourself when the journey gets tough and become empowered
with super-skillset to code beautiful websites and web apps. 

### Models of Learning
At some point your instructor will offer you some understanding models which are theoretical to facilitate in your understanding
of certain concepts. These models will go a long way to make things easy as you journey along your coding life.

### Advice
Don't compare yourself to no one. It is useless. 
Your progress is unique. Enjoy your mistakes.
Programming reveals you to yourself, especailly how you think.
You'll relise that some solve problems in a very logical-step way while you may solve yours in a creative style.
Even how we write codes will be different. 

As you begin focus on what works and dont get bogged down to unneccessary arguments of tabs vs spaces!
