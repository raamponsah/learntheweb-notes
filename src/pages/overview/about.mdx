The workshop is typically designed for beginners or intermediate developers who want to learn the fundamentals of web development or expand their existing skills.

During the workshop, attendees will learn about the technologies and tools used in web development, including HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. They will learn how to use these technologies to structure and format web pages, create interactive elements, and build responsive and mobile-friendly websites.

#### The workshop will cover a wide range of topics, including:

- Creating interactive web pages with JavaScript, including using functions, loops, and other programming concepts

- Building responsive and mobile-friendly websites using media queries and CSS frameworks
  
- Working on a project to apply the skills learned in the workshop, including idea generation, planning, implementation, testing, and debugging

Throughout the workshop, attendees will have the opportunity to practice their skills through hands-on exercises and projects. They will also receive guidance and support from experienced instructors and mentors. Upon completion of the workshop, attendees will have the skills and knowledge needed to build and maintain their own web applications.
